_**Note:** This branch (`main`) is for the current version of CLEO iOS, which is written in Rust. For the original C++ version, see the [`c++` branch](https://github.com/Squ1dd13/CLEO-iOS/tree/c+%2B)._

## Completed Features
* CSA script loading
* FXT loading

## Planned Features
* CSI script loading
* IMG editing/hooking for custom models
* Sound modding
* Texture modding
* Cheat menu (for using cheats without a keyboard)

A possible change would be to integrate with the game's button control
system rather than relying on Android-style swipe gestures for showing menus.
