# CLEO iOS (Rust)
This is an attempt at a rewrite of CLEO in Rust.

CLEO v2 is (hopefully) going to be a more general-purpose modding solution for the iOS platform, with planned features
that will try to eliminate the need for a computer when installing various types of mods.

## Planned Features
* Basic CLEO features
    * CSA/CSI script loading
    * Android-style mod menu
    * Support for FXT localisations
* IMG editing/hooking for custom models
* Sound modding
* Texture modding
* Cheat menu (for using cheats without a keyboard)

A possible change would be to integrate with the game's button control
system rather than relying on Android-style swipe gestures for showing menus.
